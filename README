NAME
    jailing - a minimalistic chroot jail builder/runner for Linux

SYNOPSIS
      # create and/or enter the jail, and optionally run the command
      jailing --root=/path/to/chroot/jail [cmd ...]

      # unmount the bind mounts of the jail
      jailing --root=/path/to/chroot/jail --umount

DESCRIPTION
    The command creates a chroot jail if it does not exist, and runs the
    given commands within the jail.

    The system directories are remounted read-only (via `mount --bind` and
    `mount -o remount,ro`) to minimalize the setup time and disk usage.
    Other directories are created automatically.

OPTIONS
  --root=path
    mandatory argument specifying the root of the chroot jail. The directory
    is automatically created if it does not exist.

  --umount
    unmounts the bound mount points for the jail
